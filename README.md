## Hi there! I am Vitor Pires ðŸ˜„

ðŸ’¬ I am a computer engineer with a passion for technology since childhood, which motivated me to build a solid career in the field. Always seeking innovations, I continuously learn by exploring new technologies.\

ðŸ”­ For the past four years, I have been working at Superfrete, where I am responsible for the development and maintenance of the website, as well as the Android and iOS apps.\

âš¡ Outside the tech world, I am driven by a curiosity to learn new languages, travel, and explore different cultures. I am also an enthusiast of games, especially RPGs and chess.
